# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 

#### The purpose of this project is to help Steve create a code to analyze large amounts of stocks. The code that he has works well for a dozen stocks, but might not work or execute slowly for more stocks. Therefore, this purpose is to improve or refactor the current code to a faster and more efficient code for thousands to stocks. This project should obtain the same information using less time.

## Results

### The results from the refactored code matches those from the current code. From the results, we can see that the 12 stocks performed generally better in 2017 than 2018. In 2017, all the stocks except TERP have a positive return rate. However, in 2018, there are only two stocks, ENPH and RUN, performed positively with other stocks performing negatively (a negative return rate). The execution time for the original script for 2017 and 2018 was 0.514s and 0.508s. The refactored script executed faster than the original with 0.396s and 0.389s respectively.

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  - The advantages of refactoring a code are: 
    - Adding extensibility or flexibility to the code
    - Creates a code that is cleaner, easier to read, and easier to maintain
    - Improves the execution time of the code. 
  - The disadvantages of refactoring a code are:
    - Time consuming since there is no way to predict how much time the process will take
    - Introduction of mistakes

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA? 
  - The execution time that I got from the refactored VBA script was faster than the original VBA script. Comparing the codes for both versions, it is easier to change or add to the refactored VBA script, thus the code becomes more flexible. However, by looking at the script, I did not find the code cleaner or easier to read. The process of refactoring is very time consuming. It is also easier to introduce mistakes or bugs. Then it takes up more time to debug the mistakes.
